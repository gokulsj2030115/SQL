This repository contains SQL queries for analyzing fitness tracking data. The dataset includes participant activity details such as steps taken, calories burned, heart rate, sleep patterns, hydration levels, and workout intensity. The queries help extract meaningful insights, including:

Basic Exploratory Queries (Unique activity types, total entries, calories burned, etc.)
User Engagement Analysis (Most & least active participants, peak workout times)
Health & Performance Insights (Sleep & hydration impact on activity, BMI-based analysis)
Retention & Trend Analysis (Monthly participation, churn risk detection)
Demographic-Based Activity Trends (Age group-based fitness patterns)
This project is useful for data analysts looking to practice SQL with real-world fitness data and generate business insights.
